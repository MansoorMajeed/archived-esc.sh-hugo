I have been looking for a Linux gaming laptop for quite some time now. The search has
been annoyingly more difficult that it needs to be.

## What I needed

I needed a gaming laptop that can run Linux well. Linux and Discrete graphics don't really go well


## TL;DR

I went with a Zephyrus M16 2022 with an i9 12th Gen, RTX 3070Ti.
Linux runs flawlessly only Fedora 38. No issues whatsoever
